### Overview

The first is an OVERVIEW Entry - this is the Introduction, it explains the purpose of the blog, that it is documenting the freedom project (and what that is), and what you are writing about.
There is _only one_ overview entry.

*Context*
The “Freedom Project” for SEP10 is all about the students exploring a STEM related topic and creating a webstie about it.

The purpose of this blog is to explain what we did towards the Freedom Project on the days we did something towards it.

*Content*
For my project, I am making a website about Robotics using Github, HTML, CSS, and TBD

This blog will document the process of independently studying Robotics and (tbd) and making the website.

### Daily Entries

The second type are 'daily' entries. These should be completed each time you work on the Freedom Project,
whether you are working at school or at home, on research or revision. Doesn't matter. This documents the _process_ involved in its creation.
Each week there will be a new file to hold the new Blog Entry you write on Freedom Friday. The first file should be called entry1.md.
